# Bunsenlabs alternative theme

Bunselabs lithium alternative theme, based on the same color scheme than the original.

+ In order to get rounded corners, you need to install Ibhagwan picom fork as compositor https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom and use the compton.conf file provided. You must put compton.conf inside ~/.config
+ Wallpapers modified to suit the theme. I don't know the original artists, sorry.
