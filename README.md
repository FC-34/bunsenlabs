# Bunsenlabs alternative theme

Bunselabs lithium alternative theme, based on the same color scheme than the original.

+ In order to get rounded corners, you need to install Ibhagwan Picom fork as compositor https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom and use the compton.conf file provided. You must put compton.conf inside ~/.config unless you change the compositor config.
+ Wallpapers colors modified to suit the theme. I don't know the original artists, sorry.
+ Openbox theme zipped for convenience and dull comments, since I uploaded these files in a hurry from a machine without git installed.
